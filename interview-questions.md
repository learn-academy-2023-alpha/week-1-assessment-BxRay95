# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer:

Researched answer:

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: Git is the backbone of github, anything you send or pull from github you have to use git to do.

Researched answer: git is essentially a version control method where you can track and control your files and the history of your code. Github is where all of your repositories are stored on the internet. 

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: and, or, not, strictly equal

Researched answer: and or not/ && !! ! === true or false?

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

Your answer: index is the position the given item is in, starts with 0
 value is the worth of that item.

Researched answer: “value” shows the current element of the array and it is required. “index” refers to the index of the current array element and is an optional parameter.

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: strings are outputs of text or numbers where arrays are more like organized sections of values.

Researched answer: The key difference between Array and String is that an Array is a data structure that holds a collection of elements having the same data types, while a String is a collection of characters.


5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: driver and navigator. the driver is the one putting words on paper while the navigator is directing what goes on the paper. its important to make sure both are on the same page so someone isnt getting confused as to what you are doing.

Researched answer: 2 programmers working together at one workstation, the driver writes the code and the other person is directing. the 2 should switch regularly so they are both engaged and understanding whats happening.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: to my understanding HoF are more complex functions that can assigned to variables like arrays or strings, and passed through other functions. sounds confusing, i cant wait.

2. Jest: jest is basically a javascript testing environment. ive heard its very finicky 

3. Objects: standalone entity with properties and type. 

4. Method: shorter syntax defining of a function?

5. Classes: template for creating objects, encapsulating data.
