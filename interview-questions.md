# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

Your answer: driver and navigator. the driver is the one putting words on paper while the navigator is directing what goes on the paper. its important to make sure both are on the same page so someone isnt getting confused as to what you are doing.

Researched answer: Pair programming is a software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: to my understanding HoF are more complex functions that can assigned to variables like arrays or strings, and passed through other functions. sounds confusing, i cant wait.

2. Jest: jest is basically a javascript testing environment. ive heard its very finicky 

3. Objects: standalone entity with properties and type. 

4. Method: shorter syntax defining of a function?

5. Classes: template for creating objects, encapsulating data.
